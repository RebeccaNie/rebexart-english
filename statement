My name is Rebex, and I have been playing with lines and colors for as long as I can remember. I actively study the visual traditions of the oriental and indigenous cultures during my journey of life that starts in Mainland China, continues to the Canadian Pacific Coast, and is now on going in Northern California. After finishing postsecondary and graduate education at the University of Toronto and Stanford University, I further embrace my serious pursuit in traditional art. A committed meditator and trained in theoretical physics, I strive to portray the everlasting delicacy of everyday experience and the ever-changing beauty of the wold around us and through my work. The understandings and visions from my inner work are constant sources of inspiration for my art.
